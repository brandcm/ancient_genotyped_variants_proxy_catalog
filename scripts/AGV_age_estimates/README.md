This directory contains files used to retrieve and analyze allele age estimates from the Human Genome Dating project. Scripts are listed in the order in which they should be run.

- `retrieve_HGD_gnomAD_allele_frequencies.sh` retrieves global allele frequencies from gnomAD v2.1.1 for all variants that have a "PASS" filter in the HGD and places frequencies in a new subdirectory in the `data/AGV_age_estimates/` directory.

- `retrieve_HGD_AGVs.sh` implements `map_gnomAD_AFs.py` to retrieve age estimate information for AGVs present in the HGD dataset and maps allele frequencies from gnomAD (generated above) to each variant.

- `concat_AGVs_with_age_estimates_and_AFs.sh` concatenates the individual chromosome-level outputs from above into a single file.

- `generate_allele_frequency_matched_random_sample_for_AGV_age_estimates.sh` implements `generate_allele_frequency_matched_random_sample_for_AGV_age_estimates.py` to generate a random sample of allele ages from the Human Genome Dating project that matches on 100 allele frequency bins (0-0.01, 0.01-0.02, etc.) and the distribution of data sources (Combined, Simons Genome Diversity Project, Thousand Genomes Project).
