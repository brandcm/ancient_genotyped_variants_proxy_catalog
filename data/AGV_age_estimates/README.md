Please note that two files in this data directory are too large to house on GitHub and can be found [here](https://ucsf.box.com/s/xbpvj9h42o2u4mkdzjgev9figc5fbg2d) in the `AGV_age_estimates/` subdirectory. The `gnomAD_AFs/` and `tree_sequence_age_estimates/` subdirectories as well as the chromosome-level `chr*_AGVs_with_age_estimates_and_AFs.txt` are not included here as the relevant concatenated data is present in the other three data files.
